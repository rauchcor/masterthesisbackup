Subject:\\
``Best Practice Authentication and Authorization''
\end{center}


\begin{abstract}
	The pressure for developers to find appropriate authentication and authorization methods is extreme. The selected architecture for the authentication and authorization of a system should reliably protect sensitive data while not compromising the user experience. This thesis is dedicated to helping developers find an identity management architecture together with comprehensive security controls suitable for a modern application architecture including a Single Page Application. Therefore, the identity management system is split up into categories, which are identity proofing, authentication, and assertion. These categories are analyzed and possible Level of Assurance are discussed. Furthermore the advantages of federation solutions with Single Sign-on functionality and token-based authentication are pointed out. A risk assessment is conducted to find the most appropriate Level of Assurance and the corresponding security controls for a given use case. Followed by a best practice example in which the implementation represents an identity management architecture featuring the security controls suggested by the risk assessment. The best practice example also considers the requirements of modern application architectures. Subsequently a lightweight frontend with an Application Programming Interface serving as a backend, protected by a token service. The result of the best practice example shows that the suggested security controls of the risk assessment were very helpful and lead to a comprehensive solution.
