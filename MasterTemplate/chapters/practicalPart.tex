\section{Use Case}
This use case is entirely fictional but allows the reader to get a better understanding of the circumstances a that led to the design of a federated authentication solution. The scenario features a medium to large company with up to 1000 employees. The mission of the company is to provide a network and analyzing toolset which allows the customer of the product suite to improve security within his network and keep an overview of potential security risks. Previously the customers received monthly reports about their current state of the network. Each of the products and tools resulted in a separate report which was sent via E-Mail. To modernize the approach, the reports should be replaced by a modern single-page application that could be accessed by customers and by employees for administrative reasons. In this example, we call the solution 'Security Assessment Portal.' The Security Assessment Portal should give the customers an overview of current products and the performance of the network an example of the suit could be E-Mail-filtering.  

The company already has a particular set of internal applications that are used by the employees within the company network. The company internally uses active directory for authorization on local machines. All applications until now are accessible within the companies network and use windows authentication. The application should be accessible by employees as well as customers whereas customers should not receive access to the company network. The data of the customers are sensible and therefore worth protecting. Because of the highly sensible data, certain customer do not need which to authenticate with an external provider. The application should be hosted within the company a solution for customers to access the application from outside is needed.
