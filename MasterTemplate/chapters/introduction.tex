With the rise of social networks, online services experienced a revolution quite recently and thus have had a significant impact on the way private information gets propagated on the Internet. Developers split up solutions into backend and frontend applications and build their backend solutions as Application Programming Interfaces (API) which can be used to propagate services online. Published APIs can then be consumed by frontend applications or even third-party applications. This approach especially gained popularity with the rise of mobile and single page applications, which heavily depend on a light-weighted fronted. However using APIs to access the business logic means, that the trust relationship is not between two parties but also may include third-party applications. This uncertain trust relationship raises concerns of users and developers regarding security and privacy of personal information. Building trust is a substantial part for architects and developers when designing a system. In order to efface security and privacy concerns of users an advanced access and identity management system is needed. [cf. (\cite{Cirani:OBAS}), (\cite{Tkalec:2015}), (\cite{Rossvoll:2013:RUBIM})].


\section{Problem Statement}

In traditional architectures, a third party receives the user’s credentials for the user to be able to access information from the third party as stated before. \cite{Prasad:MMWPT} however points out that sharing the credentials with a third party might lead to security problems. Third parties might be responsible for fatal security gaps, for example by storing passwords in plain-text. \cite{Prasad:MMWPT} further states that the compromise of one third-party will then lead to the compromise of the credentials of the end user. As a result, the safety of the secure resources cannot be granted anymore. Moreover, third-parties will receive the comparatively more significant amount of access to the user data than needed. Another concern is pointed out by \cite{Sakimura:OIDCC}, which is that users often are required to create new accounts for each service they want to use. On the one hand the process of creating a new account for a service can be annoying for the user because they have to burden of keeping track of multiple accounts and remembering multiple credentials. On the other hand the complex task of managing this accounts can led to problems like password fatigue and in the worst case to identity theft or the compromise of services [cf. (\cite{Sakimura:OIDCC}), (\cite{Prasad:MMWPT})].

This common problems with a modern application setup, where the backend application is represented by an API, lead to the question, what is the best way to secure these applications and which of the existing approaches is best for a particular case. Furthermore what risks come with the use of a certain approach and what is the state of the privacy.  


\section{Research Question}

What are feasible ways to implement authentication and authorization for enterprises that depend on adaptability and focus on modern single page applications? How can businesses find out with identity management system is best suited for their use case? Furthermore, what are benefits of the token-based authentication with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect versus traditional authentication methods? These questions should be elaborated while considering common security risks of modern web applications.

\section{Hypothesis}

In modern architectures, a third party often is responsible for the implementation of the process of authentication and authorization of the user. Considering the setup of a company and the use case of the authentication and authorization of users, the requirements towards identity management can be very different. \cite{NIST:2017:DIG} suggest for identity management, to rely on standards and specifications that are widespread and documented. Example for tools and standards include Internet protocols for accessing services like REST, SOAP, and XML and federate identity standards for service authentication such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

In this thesis, the focus is on modern distributed architectures and ways to provide users secure access to protected resources and confidential management of the user’s credentials for a specific scenario. The question to be answered is what kind of identity management system is best suited for a use case to reduce common identity threads 


\section{Method}

In order to prove the described hypothesis the following method is applied:
  
\begin{itemize}
  	\item Acquire knowledge about authentication and authorization methods
  	\item Analysis of risks based on a use case
  	\item Develop a best practice example
\end{itemize}

The priority was to make extensive research on the topic to get an overview of the current state of authentication and authorization methods. After the research before starting to analyze the different methods of authentication and authorization, a case for an assessment is defined and described in detail. Based on this case a risk assessment is executed and the according to the level of assurance is a determent. The level of assurance need for this case allows choosing the appropriate technologies to mitigate risks and the impact of errors. With this set of technologies and example solution for a modern enterprise single page application is created to give a best practice example based on the theatrical gathered knowledge.
