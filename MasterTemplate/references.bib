	abstract="Through the last five years, we, in the security field, have been witnessing an increase in the number of attacks to (web) application user's credentials, and the refinement and sophistication these attacks have been gaining. There are currently several methods and mechanisms to increase the strength of the authentication process for web applications. To improve the user authentication process, but also to improve the transaction authentication. As an example, one can think of adding one-time password tokens, or digital certificates, EMV cards, or even SMS one-time codes. However, none of these methods comes for free, nor do they provide perfect security. Also, one must consider usability penalties, mobility constraints, and, of course, the direct costs of the gadgets. Moreover, there's evidence that not all kinds of attacks can be stopped by even the most sophisticated of these methods. So, where do we stand? What should we choose? What kind of gadgets should we use for our business critical app, how much will they increase the costs and reduce the risk, and, last but not least, what kind of attacks we'll be unable to stop anyway? This presentation will focus on ways to figure out how to evaluate the pros and cons of adding these improvements, given the current threats.",

In this paper, we describe the common threats that can be identified when using security tokens such as smart cards in web applications. We illustrate each of these threats with a few attack scenarios. This paper is part of a series of papers, written by several academic teams.

	abstract="Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and data maintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied. The access control decision is enforced by a mechanism implementing regulations established by a security policy. Different access control policies can be applied, corresponding to different criteria for defining what should, and what should not, be allowed, and, in some sense, to different definitions of what ensuring security means. In this chapter we investigate the basic concepts behind access control design and enforcement, and point out different security requirements that may need to be taken into consideration. We discuss several access control policies, and models formalizing them, that have been proposed in the literature or that are currently under investigation.",

	abstract="At present, network users have to manage one set of authentication credentials (usually a username/password pair) for every service with which they are registered. Single Sign-On (SSO) has been proposed as a solution to the usability, security and management implications of this situation. Under SSO, users authenticate themselves only once and are logged into the services they subsequently use without further manual interaction. Several architectures for SSO have been developed, each with different properties and underlying infrastructures. This paper presents a taxonomy of these approaches and puts some of the SSO schemes, services and products into that context. This enables decisions about the design and selection of future approaches to SSO to be made within a more structured context; it also reveals some important differences in the security properties that can be provided by various approaches.",
